# Tools of the Trade 2021-2022 
## Bringing Research into the Classroom
---
Tool of the Trade is a lunchtime series on the last Friday of each month, by Researchers for Researchers, in collaboration with ACENET. The idea is to share knowledge and make connections with and between researchers in Atlantic Canada, who are interested in or are already using digital tools in their research. The theme for the upcoming academic year is *Bringing Research into the Classroom*. We will be sharing methods and resources for introducing digital research projects to students, highlighting opporutnities for student and faculty training in digital skills, and facilitating discussions and conversations around how we can ethically and sustainably equip faulty, students, and research teams as they navigate a complex and rapidly changing digital world.
